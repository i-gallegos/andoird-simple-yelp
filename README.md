## Notes

This was my first time querying an API before, so it took a little bit of time for
me to understand how our code interacted with the Yelp API.  This app helped me
feel more familiar with the adapter, but I still didn't feel quite comfortable enough
with querying the API to be able to implement some of the more advanced extensions.
But I think this gives me a good starting point for more projects like this in the
future!
